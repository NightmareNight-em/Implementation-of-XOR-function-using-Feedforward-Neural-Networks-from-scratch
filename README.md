<h2>Feedforward Neural Networks</h2>

The feedforward and the backpropagation (using gradient descent algorithm) function implemented in vanilla python explains the working of Neural Networks.<br>
I have made use of <i>Numpy</i> library for basic mathematical calculations.
To gain intuition on Feedforward Neural Networks , I suggest this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&t=672s">video</a> by 3BLUE1BROWN.<br>
He has explained extremely well.
